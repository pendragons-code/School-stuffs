	Assimilation: 

	In a country where the government adopts a policy of assimilation, immigrations are expected to adopt the beliefs and practices of the majority group in the host country. Over time, this is supposed to make the identity of the immigrants indistinguishable from the majority group in aspects such as cultural beliefs and practices.

		Team baguette and assimilation:
		
		A country which adopts a policy of assimilation is france. France believes in the principle of Laïcité ('secularism'). In France, there is a clear seperation of religious affairs from governance and no religion is favoured over another. The approach of assimilation takes the form of expecting all French citiizens to identify with the principle of secularism.

		{assimilation in Singapore}:

		Singapore also practices secularism. However, in Singapore's context, individuals have the freedom to express their faith through the wearing of religious items. This is slightly different from france where visible displays of religious identity are less acceptable.

		Assimilation in education:
		
		The system will try to establish and strengthen national identity of a citizen, for example, in france, there is not discussion of religion in the classroom, except in history and philosophy classes.

		Assimilation in employment:

		The employment of immigrants is committed to stay on in the country, which helps to hasten the acquisation of social capital. Furthermore, they must use french for communication. However, the unemployment rate of 2007 of immigrant families was three times the national average. One of the reasons for this was discrimination in the hiring practices of companies. Assimilation is not very effective in employment.

		This causes disagreements with regard with the policy due to the oppression they felt. Therefor, protest and civil unrest is brought upon due to assimilation.



	Integration:

	Besides assimilation, a government can also adopt an integration approach towards immigrants. This is where the immigrants retain their unique identities while forging common ground with the groups already living in the host country.


	Integration in singapore:
	--> Bilingual policy
	--> Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) (made to mix racial groups in hdb estates --> mix groups --> racial harmony --> protect singapore's social fabric.)
	--> Group Representation Constituency (GRC) (Formed to ensure that the people of minority groups are represented in parliment.)
	--> Presidential Council of Minority Rights (PCMR) (Created to prevent parliment from discriminating against a racial or religious community.)


	Common experiences:

	Opportunities to interact with locals will help immigrants adapt to being part of Singapore society. Common experience build ties between immigrants and the larger Singapore society to encourage immigrants to develop better understanding and to interact outside of their own communities. One such example is national service. All permanent resident and citizens must go through national service, that fosters the security and sovereignty of the nation. It can also protect the social fabric of the nation.

	Tensions from integration:

	Immigrants that are not fully integrated sometimes feel isolated or feel uncomfortable. Some singaporeans feel that the immigrants are there to take away the economic, housing and other opportunities. Immigrants are also sometimes blamed for the increament of prices in products. And since there are more people in the nation now, the people sometimes blame the immigrants that use the infrastructure, causing congestions in the MRT.

[Chapter 8: What does it mean to live in a globalized world?]

	Globalisation can be understood as a process through which ideas and activities of people in different parts of the world become interconnected. These interconnections can lead to inderdependent relationships between developments in the world and developments in a country. Although the term "globalisation" has been widely used since the 1990s, it is not a new development. Some peoe arguethat it began in the 19th century or earlier when people started exploring other countries, therefore creating interconnections of ideas and activities across the world.
	Globalisation today is different because of the pace at which it is occuring. Three keys driving forces have caused the pace of globalisation to increase rapidly in this century. They are creating interconnections between ideas and activities of people in different parts of the world at a greater frequency and intensity than before. Some of these interconnections can create interdependence between countries. The three key driving forces of globalisation explored in this chapter are developments in transportation, growth of MultiNational Corporations (MNCs) and advancements in technology.
	
	Development in transportation:
		The world seems to have "shrunk" in terms of the time needed to get from one place to another. This is achieved through improvements in the size and speed of the different modes of transportation, and the development of efficient and integrated transportation infrastructure such as airports, seaports, railways and expressways. Improvements made to the size and speed of transportation modes enabled more goods and people to be carried per trip. This lead to savings in transport cost. When goods and people can be moved around the world more quickly and at a lowercost, it facilitates the process through which people's activities and ideas become interconnected.

	Transportation in Singapore.
		Singapore's transportation system is an example of an efficient and integrated transportation infrastructure which facilitates the movement of people and goods, and in turn the exchange of ideas, between countries. The extensive rail and road networks provides a high degree of connectivity between Singapore and malaysia. Singapore's connectivity to the world is also achieved through its airports and seaports. The provision of effecient, reliable and quality service, Singapore has been recognised as one of the world's leading transportation hubs. However, it is facing stiff competition from many regional and international hubs such as those in malaysia and hong kong. Malaysia is allocating more resources to upgrade its infrastructure and capabilities while hong kong continues to strengthen its transport connections with other cities and countries worldwide.
		To maintain its lead in the face of increasing competition from other transportation hubs, such as those in malaysia and hong kong, Singapore has continuously improved its transportation infrastructure. It has done so by increasing it capabilities and capacities. These efforts to improve transportation infrastructure can translate into more efficient and faster movement of goods and people across the world.

	Growth of  MultiNational Corporations (MNCs)
		MNCs are business with economic activites in more than one country. As MNCs continue to grow in their numbers and size, they control more aspects of international trade and investment. The global span of their operations drive globalisation as they increase the economic interconnections between people abd goods throughout the world. These interconnections between the people and goods throughout the world. These interconnections can also lead to interdependent relationships between parties involved in the operations of the MNCs.

	MNCs in Singapore
		There are many of them in singapore, both locally-owned and foreigned owned. This makes Singapore a major site of international businesses today. Since its independence in regions and countries across the world. In the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, many singaporeans companies created interconnections and interdependent relationships between economic activities in singapore and the rest of the world.

		Foreign owned MNCs have brought many benefits to singapore in terms of providing employment, higher wages and bringing in new technology and expertise to sustain Singapore's competitveness. In turn, these MNCs have benefitted from Singapore's strengths as a global business city with a pro-business environment governed by the rule of law. This allows MNCs to facilitates the exchange of ideas between countries


	Advances in Technology:
		Technological advancements in communication have resulted in greater access to the internet and increasing the use of mobile communications. These facilitate the communication and exchange of information across the world.





[Chapter 9: How do we respond to tensions arising from some economic impacts of globalization?]

Most countries have benefitted from increased tax revenue earned, a country can improve its infrastructure. The population may benefit too, as the increase in trade and business makes available greater variety of goods and services for consumption. In view of the benefits derived, it is therefore not surprising that most countries try to leverage the opportunities from participation in the gloabl economy. The global economy has been vital to Singapore's survival. With limited natural resources to support production for its own consumption, Singapore looks to the global economy for its expertise, products and services. Given small domestic or local markets, Singapore encourages foreign investments and invests in other countries in order to remain competitive and sustain its economic growth. In the early years of independence, with little resources and expertise, and high employment it was necessary for Singapore to attract foreign investors. Labour intensive industries were especially sought after as they provided jobs for the locals. However, industries were especially sought after as they provided jobs for the locals. However, by the late 1970s, countries with larger populations offered lower labour costs compared to Singapore. In order to remain competitive and maintain economic growth, Singapore focused on more technology and informations-driven industries.
Due to Singapore's small populations and hence, its small markets for goods and services, it needs to tap on the global economy for trade, which in turn can sustain its economic growth. One way this is possible is through foreign direct investments (FDI). FDI refers to investments in a Singapore company by a company from another country.Singapore attracts foreign investors because Singapore's ability to enable businesses to enhance and strengthen their important activities here to leverage economic opportunities in Singapore. In doing so, they can expand their business in Asia and the rest of the world.

Free Trade Agreements (FTAs):
--> are treaties between countries that establishes a free trade area where the exchange of goods and services can be conducted without issues
--> these issues can include tariffs, hindrances across borders
--> This serve to benefit singapore and partnering countries, saving money while introducing more trade
	One example: --> USSFTA (United State-Singapore Free Trade Agreement) benefitted the IT, chemical, textile and petrochemical industries.

	Pros:
		--> newer opportunities available in a global economy
			--> strengthen global economy
			--> greater trade means that more companies looking to set up in Singapore
			--> This will generate more tax revenue but will create more job ooportunities for singaporeans as well
			--> this all brings overall beneficial growth for singapore's economy
	
	Cons:
		--> due to FTAs domestic products have more competition from the foreign products that are now cheaper
			--> affects sales and in turns causes the company to make a loss
			--> affects lifelyhood of employees, local businesses and produces
			--> causing them to close down
			--> not everybody benefits as much as is projected to be
			--> economic downturn

	Economic downturn:
		In a global economy, when the economy of once country faces downturn, it can affect the economy of others.
		Downturn can cause countries to pull out investments or reduce demands for goods and services from other countries. This leads to lesser income and employment for the countries affected. Read up about the 2008 crisis for an example that we can throw for contextual knowledge.
	
	Economic impacts on Companies:
		Development in transport and advancements in tech have allowed companies to benefit from globalisation. This is because many companies are able to widen their market reach by expanding production and sales of goods around the world. They have great opportunities to benefit from higher profits and larger market share. This expansion, however, often means that increased competition from other companies which are similarly trying to expand their market reach and profits.
	
	Hgher profits and market share

	MNC can obtain higher profits is by setting up their operations in different locations, this allows not only acess to new markets abroad, but also access to lower labour costs and cheaper resources such as land and raw materials. There are also MNC that obtaintheir components from one location but assemle them in different parts of the world  where production costs would be lower.
	
	American companies have been dominating the global companies because they have been able to leverage opportunities arising from the global economy. An exmaple of an american MNC is PepsiCo which produces items such as potato chips, orange juice and oats.

	Many Singapore companies have also gained higher profits by going global as they expand their p[erations overseas. These companies offer a wide range of products and services, from healthcare, food and fashion to their Technological expertise. To support these companies in their overseas ventures, the singapore government offers assistance such as loans, grants and tax incentives. This enables the companies to take advantage of the opportunities presented by globalisation.

	Lower profits and market share

	While globalisation has increased access to new markets for companies, they also face increased competition from other companies in the global economy. This is a trade-off that occurs because of the impact of globalisation on companies. It could, therefore, become harder for them to compete for a share of profits from the global economy. To remain successful, a company needs to constantly innovate and reinvent itself or risk losing its share of the market or profits.

	One way to do this is by constantly introducing new features into its products and services. All businesses must always anticipate how a market might change and ensure that their products and services remain relevant. What would happen if a company fails to respond to competition.

	Alongside the MNCs are the small and medium enterprises (SMEs). These SMEs are important to Singapore's economy as they contribute more than 50 percent of economic output and 70 percent of employment in Singapore.

	Since the year 2000, globalisation has resulted in an increased in the spread of MNCs, bigger local companies and SMEs. Many SMEs have found themselves unable to compete with larger companies that offer the same products or services. There are many Challenges that SMEs face, such as a small domestic market and shortage of expertise and labour. As a result, many SMEs are unable to earn enough profit to sustain their operations.

	Some problems SMEs face:
	--> Shortage of expertise
	--> Shortage of labour
	--> Small domestic market
	--> Insufficient profits
	--> Competition from bigger companies

	However, some SMEs are able to respond more positively to competition because they understand local conditions and choose to offer goods and services that apeeal to the locals. Other are also able to play a complementary role to MNCs. For example,MMI Holdings, an SME, is a supplier of hard drive disks for the US-based Seagate Technology, an MNC.

	 As SMEs are very important to Singapore's Economy, the Singapore government is committed to helping them cope with increasing competition.

	 Some incentives includes:
	 --> Provides various forms of financial assistance to help SMEs at different stages of growth
	 --> Aids in SME's efforts to venture abroad
	 --> Facilitates partnerships between SMEs and larger corporation
	 --> Provides financial assistance in the form of loans, grants and tax incentives

	 Like SMEs, MNCs which are unable to anticipate changing markets and ensure that its products and services remain relevant and competitive could also face lowered profits and bankruptcy. In 2012, French hypermarket chain, Carrefour, closed its only branch in Singapore after 15 years. This was due to competition from other companies offering similar products in Singapore.
