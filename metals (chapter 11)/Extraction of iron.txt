Raw material	Contains	Function
Iron ore (haematite)	| Iron(III) oxide	  | A compound that contains iron
Coke	                | Carbon	          | Burns in air to produce heat, and reacts to form carbon monoxide (needed to reduce the iron oxide)
Limestone	        |  Calcium carbonate      | Helps to remove acidic impurities from the iron by reacting with them to form molten slag
Air	                | Oxygen	          | Allows the coke to burn, and so produces heat



Removing impurities:
The calcium carbonate in the limestone thermally decomposes to form calcium oxide.

calcium carbonate → calcium oxide + carbon dioxide

CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)

The calcium oxide then reacts with silica (sand) impurities in the haematite, to produce slag - which is calcium silicate.

calcium oxide + silica → calcium silicate

CaO(s) + SiO2(s) → CaSiO3(l)

This reaction is a neutralisation reaction. Calcium oxide is basic (as it is a metal oxide) and silica is acidic (as it is a non-metal oxide).


Products and chemical reactions that take place:
Carbon dioxide: When coke burns in a blast of hot air to produce carbon dioxide, heat also gets produced.
Carbon monoxide: When the carbon dioxide rises, it reacts with more coke to form.
Haematite to iron: The carbon monoxide reduces the iron (III) oxide to form, the iron formed is molten
Impurities are removed: Limestone (calcium carbonate) is decomposed by heat to produce carbon dioxide and calcium oxide.
The calcium oxide (basic) also reacts to silicon dioxide (silicon is not a metal, reminder), that is acidic. This allows it to remove impurities in the haemetite and comes out as slag(calcium silicate).

Hot waste gases containing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen escape through the top of the furnace.
The molten slag runs to the bottom of the furnace and it floats to the top of the motlern iron. The slag and iron are then tapped off seperately.
