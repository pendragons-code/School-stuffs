The treaty of Versailles is the most important treaty in our syllabus for the ending of ww1.
The treaty acted as a catalyst for the german aggression and their future actions.

It would be wise to read these, which actually has a lot already in the TB (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles)

However, more than that the effects of the treaty which lead to the next global war, the treaty had importance itself.
The treaty primarily did the following.
	[01] that germany was  take full blame of the conflict
	[02] germany had to take the most punishment for commiting war crimes (iological ad chemical attacks)
	[03] cannot merge with austria with LON approval
	[04] needed to pay financial reperation costing 132 billion gold marks
	[05] could not have an air force
	[06] could not have more than 100000 soldiers
	[07] demilitarization of the rhinelad
	[08] the german navy had restrictions that only allowed 12 destroyers (810 long tons), 12 torpedo boats (200 long tons) , 6 pre-dreadnaughts and 6 crusiers (6000 long tons). They could not have any iron clads/submarines
	[09] limited navy personnel size of 15000
	[10] could no longer be in control of the colonies they had
	[11] Germany had to give up about 65000 kmÂ² of land. (as a side effect they lost about 7 million people)
	[12] with american influence, the treaty also included stuff that helped the german economy, labour force, spanish flu and unemployment rates.
	[13] assistance from other nations to try to establish political stbility


All these measures would have prevented another armed conflict, however, the treay was really harsh and the abdication of the kaiser caused a power vaccuum resulting in mutinies and the establishment of the german republic.
The people of germany was unhappy with the republic and the terms as it really put the people in graver economic situations.
hyper inflation + great depression + bad government strategy to revive the economy + widespread unemployment (not in order)
all became the catalyst for the next global conflicts.
