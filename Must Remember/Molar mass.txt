remember the base formula: Molar mass = mass in grams/number of moles in a substance

There were some interesting things that I noticed from the open source marker's report within and outside xinmin + comments from teachers
1) Students tend to take the wrong number (proton number), when they shoule be taking the molecular mass/nucleon number. If you forget, just look out for the bigger number.
2) In some questions, students do not know the units. Especially the ones that involve tonnes
3) Students sometimes add grams and units they should not be adding (this really depends on the question so look out)
