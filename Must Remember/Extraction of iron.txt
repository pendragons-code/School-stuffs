Iron ore (haematite)	| Iron(III) oxide	  | A compound that contains iron
Coke	                | Carbon	          | Burns in air to produce heat, and reacts to form carbon monoxide (needed to reduce the iron oxide)
Limestone	        | Calcium carbonate       | Helps to remove acidic impurities from the iron by reacting with them to form molten slag
Air	                | Oxygen	          | Allows the coke to burn, and so produces heat

Combustion of Coke:
	1) C + O₂ - > CO₂
Coke to Carbon monoxide:
	2) C + CO₂ -> 2CO
Using Carbon monoxide to remove oxygen from the haemetite. Carbon monoxide is looking for 1 more O so it acts as a really powerful snatching agent.:
	3) 3CO + Fe₂O₃ - >3CO₂ + 2Fe
Getting limestone to get lime out(calcium oxide) for purifiaction. The carbo dioxide comes from combustion
	4) CaCO₃ -> CaO + CO₂
Getting lime to react with Silicon dioxide (sand and impurities) to purify the iron.
	5) CaO + SiO₂ -> CaSiO₃



Products and chemical reactions that take place:
Carbon dioxide:  Carbon dioxide is formed when coke is burnt in hot air and when limestone is decomposed at high temperature.
Carbon monoxide: When the carbon dioxide rises, it reacts with more coke to form.
Haematite to iron: The carbon monoxide reduces the iron (III) oxide to form, the iron formed is molten
Impurities are removed: Limestone (calcium carbonate) is decomposed by heat to produce carbon dioxide and calcium oxide.
The calcium oxide (basic) also reacts to silicon dioxide (silicon is not a metal, reminder), that is acidic. This allows it to remove impurities in the haemetite and comes out as slag(calcium silicate).

Hot waste gases containing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen escape through the top of the furnace.
The molten slag runs to the bottom of the furnace and it floats to the top of the motlern iron. The slag and iron are then tapped off seperately.
