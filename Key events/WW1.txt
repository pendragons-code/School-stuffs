[1] Parties involved:

	Most of the parties involved were those that were a part of Europe. Nations from other continents include ocenia, Africa, asia, North america and South america.
		[Major Roles in our syllabus]: Europe, Africa, Asia, North America
			[France] sent about 8.4 million soldiers to war, 1.4 million dead, 4.3 million wounded and 0.54 million missing
			[British empire] sent about 8.9 million soldiers to war, 0.9 million dead , 2 million wounded and 0.2 million missing 
			[Russia] sent about 12 million soldiers to war, 1.7 million dead, 4.9 million wounded and 2.5 million missing
			[Germany] sent about 11 million soldiers to war, 1.1 million dead, 4.1 million wounded and 1.2 million missing
			[Italy] sent 5.6 million soldiers to war, 0.65 million dead, 0.95 million wounded and 0.6 million missing
			[USA] set 4.3 million soldiers to war, 0.13 million dead, 0.24 million wounded and 4500 missing
			[Austria] 8 million soldiers to war, 1.2 million dead, 3.6 million wounded, 2.2 million missing



		[Minor Roles]: South America was not heavily involved in the conflict and there were only 2 nations that were regarded as involved.
			[Mexico]:
				Zimmermann Telegram was a diplomatic communication issued from the German Foreign Office in Jan 1917 that proposed a military alliance with germany and mexico if USA got involved in WW1
				(Why is this important?) Because it got USA angry that germany was contacting USA's neighbours to threaten national security. German Foreign Secretary also admitted on March 3 that the telegram was real, which caused american anger against germany and stand for US involvement in WW1. The reason why germany would attempt such a thing was because germany was not prepared for russian resistance to become strong enough (yes quickly died down when they sent lenin over to start a revolution), and because of that, many resources has been spent trying to stop war on 2 fronts. It was also not helping how USA has been exporting weapons to the allied powers and that the US economy became reaslly powerful.
	
			[Brazil]: Not directly involved in the conflict as under the hague conference they remained neutral. However, they were still attacking german military (primarily naval) assets that threatened their ability to export items such as latex and coffee. in 1914, it declared neutrality and Brazil, had many issues at the time, including social economic crises. Brazil was primarily an agricultural exporter and barely had any industrial capability. Involvement of attacking german assets stepped up when Germany wanted to block many of the allied ports (u-boat Campaign).This economic issues became worse when Britan started banning coffee as it saw that it was occupying capacity that was neccessary to aid the military and civilians that were a part of the british empire.
	
			Since this is not heavily covered in our syllabus, I will not touch too much, but due to the conflict, Brazil initially broke relations with germany and ended up declaring war with limited support. The members of the army was attached to several Allied units that fought on the western front. The navy also took part in an anti submarine campaigh that took out german naval assets that threatened to sink steamships that exported goods.

Many people feel that the assasination was the reason why the war started, personally, I think that war would happen if the archduke was not assinated any due to the social-economic situations of the time. Monarchys and arms-races that failed to prevent war easily led up to conflict, Europe being the a cesspool of it would end have a lot of conflict coming out of it anyway.
People at the time were working towards independence, becoming the nations that we have today. What could have been done was to prevent civil war and just have peaceful transitions of power (easier said than done for many reasons, greed, culture and more).
Should the people at the time worked towards repairing global relationships and making tough policies, the LON and other organisations would have been able to prevent war. Especially the string of conflicts that would follow till now. Many political, cultural, social and economical situations are influenced by the bad decisions of the time.
