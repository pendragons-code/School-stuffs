The first and second Sino japanese wars had very little to do with what is covered in our syllabus, and if you are in a rush, it may not be smart to remember everything here. But still some things like the marco polo bridge incident and smaller battles must be noted as they act as a prelude and a part of the second world war.

Before these topics come into mind, we must remember the timeline of the prolouge, the event itself and the epilogues.

First Sino Japanese war:
	--> those familiar with japanese history will benefit here
		--> Japan
			--> Had the meiji government become the new government by overthrowing the existing shogunate(tokugawa).
			--> They consisted mostly of samurai and ronins unhappy with many of the decisions at the time and lacked intellectuals
			--> This led to the need for intellectuals to reorganize and restructure ruling significantly.
			--> Manages to get the people and more importantly, the armies of different warlords and territories to unite.
			--> central government has been establish (warlords lost power as the state and the emperors now have more power.)
			--> similar to many countries that have just lost a leader, they struggled to choose between authoritarian dictatorships and using overseas models (democracies, constitutional monarchies, early communism [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism#:~:text=In%201793%2C%20Restif%20first%20used,as%20a%20form%20of%20government.])
			--> ended up going something similar to constitutional monarchy [monarchy with democracy, useful resource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Constitution]
			--> full details here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Meiji_Japan]
			--> had always been fighting with china over territiories in the asian pacific
			--> had too many wars and conflicts to fully document
			--> Due to many of the samurai being heavily involved in politics, it led to many military reforms and increased armaments (they modeled it after the french)
			[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War#Opening_moves]
			--> possible reasons include the sino-french war that primarily affected indo-china, colonies of china in a specific region, modern day vietnam, cambodia, laos and small territories of burma and thailand[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-French_War]
			--> modernized with new tech, muskets, cannons and small arms
			--> japanese victory

		--> China
			--> lost to the french
			--> hated japan since japan had a lot of wars with them already
			--> was very worried about the situation, militarizing rapidly, while not doing so effectively
			--> tried projecting its power with military might in korea and other areas
			--> had a very bad military, consisting of untrained soldiers and para-military groups with questionable effectiveness
			(eight banners)
			--> still using old tech
			--> ineffective monarchy lead to ineffective efforts of modernization.
			--> lost a lot of territiories easily (manchuria, port arthur, weihaiwei)
			--> chinese loss
			--> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War#aftermath

		--> Korea
			--> was a colony of the qing, along with indo-china
			--> Had many treaties between Japan and china. (some that came out from the general sherman incident)
			--> Had historically too many conflicts with china and Japan to fully document
			--> Had wars with other countries and internal conflict.
			--> temporarily became independent
		
		--> taiwan
			--> was a part of china at the time and the island was targetted by the japanese for military reasons.








Why is this all here? because for a long time Japan has been treated as a weak country and worked hard to get stronger.

		--> sec 1 work, boxer rebellion and eight nation alliance
			--> joined to invade china with7 other countries
		--> Russo-Japanese war
			--> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War
			--> japanese victory
			--> russian revolution

felt cheated for not getting as much credit and they were not well respected as their other allies, at the same time was a major contributor while having little say.
		--> Sino-german alliance
		Japan wanted to continue to push for respect in the world military ranking and felt that they had very little say in matter regarding the events of ww1. The japanese had huge involvement, but felt cheated as they did not get as much credit.

			--> helped china build up the military
			--> provided economic aid for industrialization and improved approval rates of the government at the time
			ended when japan took nanking, during the sino-japanese war (before ww2)hitler discouraged japan from attacking since the great depression's effects may have weakened but germany just established stable trade with china
			--> sided with japan in the end since USSR was hitler's (ww2) main target for living space and japan was strong enough to help fight the USSR


		took over many areas of the chinese territory
