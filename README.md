So I ran out of space on google drive and i resorted to uploading stuff on github because I am a programmer.    

I don't know man, it just all made sense to me.   



As to why I'm not putting the hydrocarbons stuff here, it's because I will be tired of trying to represent the bonds with `| \ /`. So I'm not doing that. I may upload pics instead. ~MAY~
