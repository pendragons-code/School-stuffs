# School-stuffs
A drive to contain all of my school stuff. Apparently I reached the limit of google drive so idk man.       
History coming soon! (it will be coming in phases)                  
    
    
Trust me! I would like to nerd out on the military, technological and political progress of the time, but I am help back by what is in the syllabus, talk to me if you are for some reason interested lmao.         

Now you may notice that the content here is not what usually i recommend that you study. However, with the recent prelims showing us that the essay being the most deducting section, I have decided to work on essays since the SBQ is literally just using those few skills, rinse and repeat. It is more important to push the essay so that you can sustain humans results.         

so yes, no china turning communist here and a lot more stuff that will not be covered since this is now the essay component in mind.
It is easier to hope that the exams cover Korean war instead as in terms of content that is the least. But it can become a gamble since less content means that you are less likely to bullshit your way to marks.

# Concerns

I was told that a lot of people are concerned with the fact that the items are not lined in chronological order + I have basically been pasting a better version of the TYS answers i uploaded on another repo, but really, i am sure that these notes will genuinely help you.
