Uploading some notes and stuff here since i am out of space on google drive. Also because I'm a dev. But mainly because I am a dev.   
Yes, that said the idea of branches is different here. Because most people (non-devs) have a hard time or have disdain in doing so (same, I rather use git with my fav IDE), I will be using branches to devide the subjects accordingly.   

To people who wanna see the things: tap on `view code`
To people who wanna jump to other branches: click on the thing that says: `branches: main` and jump to the subject in question. At the same time, pray that we have the same subject combination.   


to clone: 
```
git clone -b <branch name> "URL here"
```


`POA` is the main `POA` branch. `POA-POA-POA` and `random` are backup brances that exists, that I periodically use, ignore those.
