# why github?
Github and git were made to improve code distrubution, making changes and workflow. It allowed things like distributed repositories and branching that allows people to make changes better. More [here (profanity warning in video).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8)   

This same ability to improve distribution and more change making for code better can be used to make changes to notes for better sharing and addition of missing components, correcting whatever is wrong. This is thanks to the nature of git/githu that was aiming for better collaboration (if you are for some reason interested in the history, basically a kernel dev, linus torvalds, the creator of linux, was working on linux with a huge community. He needed a system that was better than what was existing at the time and therefor he made a code management system, git, that was superior to what was available to the time.). Git/github allows us to get around the issues of the systems tha the teachers use that include the lack of ease in distrubution and a really bad way of making changes (telling the teacher something is missing and getting them to upload whatever is missing or completely wrong).    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
# Sorry devs
To programmers, I know, that most of you will be laughing at what is said here but most of my classmates do not know what git is. Most of them are normies who can barely handle the installation of a chrome browser extension and the things they do will make you cry (DON'T TELL ME TO SHUT UP YOU KNOW IT IS TRUE). I have a git serever and I know why git is used and what it is about. And there are people who need to understand why I do these kinda things that only programmers will understand.
