# School-stuffs
A drive to contain all of my school stuff. Apparently I reached the limit of google drive so idk man.       


# why github?
Github and git were made to improve code distrubution, making changes and workflow. It allowed things like distributed repositories and branching that allows people to make changes better. More [here (profanity warning in video).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8)   

This same ability to improve distribution and more change making for code better can be used to make changes to notes for better sharing and addition of missing components, correcting whatever is wrong.
