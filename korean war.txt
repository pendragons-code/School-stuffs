Duration of korean war:
	3 years (1950 - 1953), 25 june to 27 july (armastice)

Primary parties involved:
	Communist china
	USSR
	Communist korea

	USA
	South korea
	UN forces comprising of 16 countries

Prelude: 
	Japanese occupation of korea.
	Japan occupied Korea as part of the Sino-Japanese war that saw japan take over chinese territories, including korea. The japanese ruled the area for 35 years until the surrender at the end of WW2, on 15th august 1945. The Territorries was divded along the 38th parallel without any korean consultation.The Soviets occupied to north while the USA occupied the south.As a result of tensions, the occupation zones became two nations. One a socialist, DPRK which was communist and totalitarian state. The other, a capitalist state, ROK. This was under an autocratic leadership, by syngman rhee.



	So why was there division?:

	Both nations adopted very different political ideologies, both nations also claimed to be legitimate rulers of the whole nation. None of the leaders treated the border as permenant.


Type of war:
	Civil war: A war between citizens of the same country.

	Proxy war: A war instigated by major powers which does not themselves become involved.

	The korean war is considered as both a proxy and civil war.

	Reasons why it was a civil war:
		--> Desire of unification by North and South Korean leaders
		--> Limited support from the USA and Communists from 1948 to 1950
		--> Border clashes between citizens of north and south.
	


Border clashes:
	--> Many clashes between 1949 to 1950
	--> Initiated by South Korean in attempt to capture some territory from the North
	--> North Korea retaliated, both sides suffer losses
	--> Border clashes showed inability of South Korean forces to launch any offensive against the North
	--> Many military desertions from South to North highlights how people fo not really like Rhee
	--> This made USA reluctant to send weapons to Rhee
		--> would end up in DPRK
		--> would be used against ROK forces
		--> would be very costly to equip and re-equip



Containment policy:

	Dean Acheson:
		A close advisor to the president, he was the primary author of the turman doctrine and the Marshall plan. Achesone was appointed Secretary of state in 1949. In the following years, he helped craft US containment and the formation of the (Seato as well) Nato Alliance. He also helped US involvment in Korea.
	
	Goal:
		The Truman Doctrine, also known as the policy of containment, was President Harry Truman's foreign policy that the US would provide political, military, and economic aid to democratic countries under the threat of communist influences in order to prevent the expansion of communism. 
		During the Cold War, for example, the United States could use economic containment in the form of embargoes on the Soviet bloc and China to prevent its rivals from acquiring machinery and equipment that would strengthen their military power.
	
	Marshall plan:
		
		George Marshall:
			Secretary of State George Marshall, who in 1947 proposed that the United States provide economic assistance to restore the economic infrastructure of postwar Europe.

		The Marshall Plan, also known as the European Recovery Program, was a U.S. program providing aid to Western Europe following the devastation of World War II. It was enacted in 1948 and provided more than $15 billion to help finance rebuilding efforts on the continent. The brainchild of U.S. Secretary of State George C.
		
		Nations that received the aid:
		--> Norway
		--> Netherlands
		--> Britan
		--> France
		--> Belgium
		--> West Germany
		--> Austria
		--> Denmark
		--> Ireland
		--> Italy
		--> Portugal
		--> Greece (REMEMBER)
		--> Turkey (REMEMBER)
		--> and more


Why the conflict is considered a civil war?:
	--> North Korea had requested for USSR and US forces to be withdrawn from Korea in 1947
	--> By 1949, both the Soviet Union and USA had withdrawn from their occupied zones
	--> Withdrawak gave the impression that the major powers do not wanna get involved.
	--> USA was reluctant to help (Syngman Rhee was too extreme)
	--> Stalin did not want to get involved as he did not want military confrontation with the US


Why the conflict is considered a proxy war?:
	Soviet Support:
		--> Soviets have been training and organizing the KPA (Korean People's Army) since 1948
		--> Made the NKPA a strong force.
		--> NKPA managed to push South korean and UN forces all the way to Busan.

	USA entry:
		--> Truman belived that the invasion was influnced by Stalin to spread communism in Asia.
		--> Domino theory. (one fall --> leads to another and spreads)
		--> believed US involvement was important.
		--> Asked the UN for help.
		--> UN sent a joint force to help South Korea with General MacArthur leading the Force
			--> USSR was unable to veto due to boycott
		--> By Sept 1950, US and UN forces pushed the North Korean back to the 38th parallel (and beyond at some point)

	
	Chinese Entry:
		--> UN forces continued past the 38th Parallel
		--> China warned USA and UN that the PLA would attack if they went beyond the 38th parallel.
		--> Truman told MacArthur not to fight against the chinese as he did not want to fight them.
		--> MacArthur ignored orders and moved towards the yalu river
		--> China entered the Korean War and began to push the US and UN forces back to the 38th parallel.
		--> China's involvment was on the basis that the people wanted security and a buffer to protect them from the South Koreans. Ensuring that it is unlikely the US can attack the mainland directly.


	Armastice talks (a truce to stop fighting, but not used to mark the end of a conflict. It is, however, often created before any side loses, e.g. ww1 germany):
		--> By april 1951, both sides reach a stalemate around the 38th parallel.
		--> USSR, China and USA were prepared to discuss peace.
		--> MacArthur wanted to continue with the war, especially with the usage of nuclear weapons to destroy china.
		--> Truman fired MacArthur.
		--> Both Kim and Rhee wanted to fight to the end.
			--> But they could not because they lacked support.


		--> Negotiations for the armastice lasted from 1951 to 1953
		--> Both sides wanted different things

		===============================================================================================================
		| 	What the Communist wanted 		|	What the South/UN wanted			      |
		===============================================================================================================
		| All North Korean POWs returned		| Division along the battle lines to be established           |
		| Division of Korea along 38th parallel		| All North Korean POWs to be give a choice to stay or return |
		===============================================================================================================

		--> In Jan 1953, Eisenhower replaced Truman as President, he pushed for the end of the Korean war
		--> Stalin has also died and the new leadership wanted the armastice as well
		--> Armastice eventually signed on July 1953




The conflict was initially a Civil war, that eventually became a Proxy war. USA and china got involved.

This led to the cold war to expand beyond Europe, intensified American involvement in Asian Pacific and escalation of military tensions betweent the East and West.
