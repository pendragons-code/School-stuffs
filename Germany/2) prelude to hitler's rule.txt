Can't nerd out on democratic establisments and the history behind some of them in here, but ask me anytime.

Failure of the weimar republic:
	1) terrible with economic choices
	2) was not able to solve widespread poverty
	3) was heavily affected by the economic crises that soon ensued (great depression and wall street crash)
	4) was not the best prepared at handling a pandemic (spanish flu, which did not really come from spain)
	5) increased printing of the german mark and some other related factors brought about hyper-inflation
	6) failure to repay the dawes plan of 1924 from USA (USA, gained economic might and rose over britan when they sold materials while not being directly involved in conflict in much of the first world war)
	7) occupation of the territories in the ruhr (since germany cannot provide money, france and belgium wanted to use economic output like coal, steel and more as partial payment, jan 1923 - aug 1925) and bad treatment from the french people to the germans of the area brought about much anger. (This also meant that people had less resources to work with now. = more economic drop)
	8) lack of monetary means to help the people in germany and settling the debt incurred by the events of WW1, brought about outrage directed at the weimar republic

The reasons stated above and more caused a lot of hatred against the weimar republic (weak leadership, lacking in political will, and being pushed around by other countries) acted as a catalyst for Hitler to rise to power.
