we covered why hitler wanted to expand (blood and soil, living space and beliefs of racial superiority), we now need to cover what he did:
1) invaded czechchoslovakia
2) signed munich agreement with the leaders of britan and france + mussolini
    [.] take he sudetenland and will not invade other territories
    [.] However, he still invaded and britan and france did not step in.
3) (they negotiated, but hitler was not happy with what he got)  Invasion of poland, but this time British prime minister was stricter and got france to also declare war on germany.
4) Nazi-Soviet pact
5) closed the polish corridor by connecting east prussia and germany
6) remilitarization of the rhineland
7) involvement in spanish civil war
8) unification with austria
