When hitler took over, he had to resolve some issues
	--> housing
	--> infrastructure (some areas damaged from war have not yet been fully repaired since they lacked money, also some were just too old for use)
	--> weak military
	--> weak economy
	--> most of the people at the time could not read or write
	--> political enemies
	--> removal of trade unions
	--> hindenburg not dead yet (hindenbrg is still president and can remove hitler from offie, so he needed hindenburg to die)


There are primarily 3 types of impact hitler brought about:
political
social
economic


Political:
	Night of the long knives:
		There were members in the Nazi party that were gtting too powerful, which put hitler at risk as they might retaliate (primary reason).
		Hitler's desire to consolidate his power and settle old scores.
		SA wanted to continue the revolution, implementing ideas that clashed with Hitler's need to establish political, military and economic stability for war.
	
	Got the Wehrmacht to pledge an oath of alligience.
		Will now have more control over germany with the absolute loyalty of the german armed forces (not nazi/SS btw, they may be loyal to german interest, but may not agree to the ideology)

	Night of the broken glass:
		Nazi diplomat killed by jewish boy.
		broken glass refers to the broken windows of jewish houses and stores
		Jewish goods boycott, arrest of the jews 

	Actually brought some stability the weimar government lacked.

	Establishment of allies with common goals:

	Some of the things Hitler did after becoming dictator is branching out to nations with similar ideologies.
		--> Italy (Pact of Steel)
		--> China (Sino-German alliance, but halted later on, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-German_cooperation_(1926%E2%80%931941))
		--> Japan (tripartite pact, mainly to deter USA from joining)
		--> Hungary
		--> Romania
		--> Slovakia
		--> Bulgaria
		--> Yugoslavia
		--> Croatia

Economic:
	When germany started conscription, building up the military with armament and equipment (breaking TOV)
	It opened more jobs for people since there was a greater need for coal, iron, oil, steel and more!
	--> stabalize economy
	--> controlled wages and allowed workers to strike
	--> as part of a movement to fix old and broken infrastructure and make new ones, Hitler brought in jobs in the related fields
	--> Led to improved distribution of supplies with the new infrastructure (better transport --> more resources can go around --> benefit the people)
	--> encouraged local industrues to rise
	--> subsidies companies and provided leisure time for the workers
	--> volkswagen beetle cheap car
	--> started an air force (breaking TOV --> air foce --> need planes --> build planes --> hire people --> assist economy)


Social:
	Germany very quickly became a policed state:
		--> establishing the gestapo
		--> hitler youth (brainwashed the youth of the german people, primarily to prepare them for war in the future)
		--> increased propoganda
		--> creating the SS (many members of the SA soon joined the SS after the night of the long knives took place)
		--> concentration camps (responsible for killing people that hitler considered no helpful to german society on an industrial scale)
		--> nuremburg laws (--> removal of jews from the german society)
		--> genocide
