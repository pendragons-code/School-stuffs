German logistics (tooth to tail) could not keep up with the quick progress of the german army.
The invasion of the Soviet Union was a logistical pain so great they made some sacrifices and it led to thinly spread supply lines.
These thiny spread supply lines were not beneficial to the germans and the invasion, that was launched, hit the baltic states and areas in Soviet russia
Food was already on short supply and winter made the situation worse.

In Germany, rations were cut in 1942. In his role as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, Hermann GÃ¶ring demanded increased shipments of grain from France and fish from Norway. The 1942 harvest was good, and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe.
In an attempt to resolve the shortage, in June 1942 Germany launched Fall Blau ("Case Blue"), an offensive against the Caucasian oilfields
