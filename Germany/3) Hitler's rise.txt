waffen-SS/SS(Schutzstaffel; also stylized as ᛋᛋ with Armanen runes;  was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany, and later throughout German-occupied Europe during World War II. It should be noted that these guys acted as actual soldiers)
SA (storm detachment; acted as a group that basically fought on the streets against communists)
Wehrmacht (german armed forces, the actual military, not under nazi-paramilitary)
	--> Heer (army)
	--> Luftwaffe (air force, a force that broke the TOV)
	--> Kriegsmarine (navy)


Hitler's rise to power can be broken into many sections:

How he became a political leader of a political group, chancellor, dictator (fuhrer). (In this order)


Before we look at how hitler gained power, we must see where he was before he did what he did.
Adolf Hilter was by the end of the first world war, a heavily disgruntled man against certain races, and having served the military, he felt angered by the fact that the people are not doing much to change things.
Anti-semitic, anti-communist and pro-aryan views (big racist + big political) pushed hitler to work for the army, wanting to partake in helping the nation in ridding communists, which after some gimmicks here and there, landed himself in the National Socialist German Worker's Party.



Rise to political part leader:

This acted as a platform (politically and legally) to become a political leader. Due to hitler's experience from the army, fanaticism and strong leadership, he rose the ranks really quickly. (It should be noted that this is a really complicated topic here)
Hitler soon established the SA (Storm detachment) to deter political enemies and jews that industrialist and some germans disliked (questionable).
Proceeded to partake in multiple elections.


Rise to chancellor:

Through the elections, hitler almost became president and was defeated by President von paul hindenburg.
--> support from industrialist pushed for hitler to become Chancellor
	
	[Not really tested, read if you want]
	--> [1932] Brüning resigned as Chancellor. Hindenburg appointed Franz Von Papen, a conservative, as his replacement.
	--> Reichstag elections. The Nazis became the largest party with 230 seats. Hitler demanded to be made Chancellor but Papen remained.
	--> Reichstag elections called by Von Papen to try to win a majority in parliament. Nazis lost 34 seats but remained the largest party with 196 seats.
	--> Von Papen resigned. Hindenburg appointed Kurt Von Schleicher, an army general, as Chancellor. Von Schleicher tried to split the Nazis by asking a leading Nazi called Gregor Strasser to be his Vice Chancellor. Hitler forced Strasser to decline.
	--> [1933] Von Papen and Hindenburg turned to Hitler, appointing him as Chancellor with Von Papen as Vice Chancellor. They believed they could control Hitler and get him to do what they wanted.

Rise to Dictatorship:
--> Parliment house fire:
	--> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire
	--> After the Fire Decree was issued, the Nazi-controlled police made mass arrests of communists, including all of the communist Reichstag delegates. This severely crippled communist participation in the 5 March elections. After the 5 March elections, the absence of the communists gave the Nazi Party a majority in the Reichstag, greatly assisting the Nazi seizure of total power.
	--> he Reichstag Fire Decree suspended most civil liberties in Germany, including habeas corpus, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, the right of free association and public assembly, and the secrecy of the post and telephone.[18] These rights were not reinstated during Nazi reign. The decree was used by the Nazis to ban publications not considered "friendly" to the Nazi cause.

--> Enabling act:
	--> hitler, without this could have been removed by hindenburg from office
	--> On 23 March 1933, the German parliament voted in favour of the ‘Enabling Act’ by a large majority. The Act allowed Hitler to enact new laws without interference from the president or the Reichstag (German parliament) for a period of four years.
	--> The vote could hardly be called democratic: The Reichstag was surrounded by members of the SA and the SS, the armed branches of the NSDAP. The Communist Party was absent because its members had been arrested or were on the run. Twenty-six Social Democrats did not vote for the same reason.

	--> single party rule
		--> Within three months of the passage of the Enabling Act, all parties except the Nazi Party were banned or pressured into dissolving themselves, followed on 14 July by a law that made the Nazi Party the only legally permitted party in the country. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933#:~:text=Within%20three%20months%20of%20the,permitted%20party%20in%20the%20country.)

(not really rise, but basically the first few things he did that cemented more power for hitler)
--> Actually started movements the people benefitted from
	--> breaking TOV
	--> armament
	--> more jobs
	--> economic progress
