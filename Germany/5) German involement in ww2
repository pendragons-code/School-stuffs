My inner nerd tells me that i will go on and on, so I'll stop myself.


The Holocaust occurred in the broader context of World War II. World War II was the largest and most destructive conflict in history. Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime envisioned a vast, new empire of "living space" (Lebensraum) for Germans in eastern Europe by the removal of existing populations. The Nazi goal to strengthen the German “master race” resulted in the persecution and murder of Jews and many others.
Germany started World War II by invading Poland on September 1, 1939. In subsequent years, Germany invaded 11 countries.
Most European Jews lived in countries that Nazi Germany would occupy or influence during World War II. Between 1941 and 1944, Nazi German authorities deported millions of Jews from Germany, from occupied territories, and from the countries of its Axis allies to ghettos and to killing centers.
The Nazi leadership began planning a European war from the day the Nazis came to power in late January 1933. War and genocidal policy would come to be inextricably linked.
