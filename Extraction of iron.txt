Raw material	Contains	Function
Iron ore (haematite)	| Iron(III) oxide	  | A compound that contains iron
Coke	                | Carbon	          | Burns in air to produce heat, and reacts to form carbon monoxide (needed to reduce the iron oxide)
Limestone	            | Calcium carbonate	| Helps to remove acidic impurities from the iron by reacting with them to form molten slag
Air	                  | Oxygen	          | Allows the coke to burn, and so produces heat



Removing impurities:
The calcium carbonate in the limestone thermally decomposes to form calcium oxide.

calcium carbonate → calcium oxide + carbon dioxide

CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)

The calcium oxide then reacts with silica (sand) impurities in the haematite, to produce slag - which is calcium silicate.

calcium oxide + silica → calcium silicate

CaO(s) + SiO2(s) → CaSiO3(l)

This reaction is a neutralisation reaction. Calcium oxide is basic (as it is a metal oxide) and silica is acidic (as it is a non-metal oxide).
